# Loan_Repayment_Challenge

Background: This was one of the assessments I did for a Data Scientist position at a fintech company. It was a great fun working with real data. Being one of my first Data Science projects, I had learnt alot! Thought it would be great to share it on my GitHub. Enjoy!

Note: For privacy reasons, I would not be sharing details about the company and their data. I will refer them as Company X. Though, I suppose the data is simulated anyway.

About the challenge:
Company X is constantly working to assess the risk of their applicants more accurately. Being successful
in this objective enables Company X to better price customers and mitigate losses on their portfolio of loans. The following
challenge asks to work with a data set of loan repayment. It is intentionally meant to be open ended. Company X wants to see a model built for predicting the loan risk or quality (loan repayment) on a given applicant.
